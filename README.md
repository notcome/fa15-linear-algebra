# Linear Algebra

__WARNING: No one is permitted to copy anything from this repository until
December 14th.__

This is my repository of homework for my linear algebra course in this quarter.
I have done and will continue doing extensive work to keep my classmate from
reaching this repository, including but not limited to avoid mentioning my
school’s name and the course number. __However, if you are a student of this
course, please be honest and close this page immediately.__

The reason I make this repository public is that I need the commit information
reflected in my profile as a way to relieve my procrastination, and that I don’t
want my private repository quota wasted for a non-programming project.

I will consider an appropriate license after this quarter ends. I also do not
encourage anyone to open any issue if you find a bug in my homework, for obvious
reasons.

Thank you for your cooperation.
